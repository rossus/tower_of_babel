## About

Here I'm trying to make history generator with culture evolution as the main feauture. That idea appeared after I had
tried CK2 Generator (map/mod generator for Crusader Kings 2: https://github.com/yemmlie/ck2gen).

## What it can do now

It can load map and begin the evolution of randomly generated culture in each tile (it is only plain 15X15 tiles map
called "mycenae" availible now). You can see culture tree for each tile, see atlas of original culture for any year and
short analysis of it's evolution. Also you can continue history of the world up to another year. It is also availible
to save/load your worlds.

## What to do next

Add some basic interactions between tiles. Add influence from geography and neighbouring cultures.

## Long-time goals
- Improved culture evolution and interaction
- Genocode influence on culture behavior
- Linguistic evolution
- Climate evolution
- Scientific progress
- Political evolution
- Ability to influence historical progress (gameplay)
